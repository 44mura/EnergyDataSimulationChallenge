The analysis for Challenge 1:

The analysis was carried out using the machine learning package from sklearn. Random Forests.

The data was cleaned and new variables were created from the existing ones, the only one that seemed to help the accuracy (and
therefore was kept) was the Daylight * Temperature variable. The lowest MAPE value achieved was 13.4%.

This MAPE value was calculated in the python file, pythonsetup.py, and it was automatically written to the txt file MAPE.txt.

The CSV of the results can be found in the csv file, myresults.csv, this is the file that is written to from within the python
code.
